\usage{
make.voxelforest.dt(
  trees.dt,
  minx,
  maxx,
  miny,
  maxy,
  vxl.per.sqm = 4,
  stems = F,
  ground = T,
  aggregation.func = "max",
  keep = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{trees.dt}{A data.table (or data.frame) that contains all trees that form the voxelforest provided
with specific requirements: Each row represents one individual. The columns need to
have the following names and content: X = X-coordinate of tree position, Y = Y-coordinate
of tree position; H = tree height (m), CD = tree crown diameter (m), CL = tree crown length (m),
LAD = leaf area density of the tree (m2/m3), CS = tree crown shape (coding: 1 = cylinder,
2 = spheroid, 3 = cone, 4 = icecone)}

\item{minx}{Minimum X-coordinate of the simulated area}

\item{maxx}{Maximum X-coordinate of the simulated area}

\item{miny}{Minimum Y-coordinate of the simulated area}

\item{maxy}{Maximum Y-coordinate of the simulated area}

\item{vxl.per.sqm}{Spatial resolution of the simulation in voxels per square meter}

\item{stems}{Boolean whether to include tree stems in the simulation or not}

\item{ground}{Boolean whether to include forest ground in the simulation or not}

\item{aggregation.func}{Function specifying how to deal with voxels in overlapping crowns
(that belong to more than one tree): Either the maximum, sum, mean or minimum of all
different values for that voxel can be taken, or if set to NA the values do not get
aggregated, thus multiple rows for that voxel are kept in the final voxelforest output.
Aggregation can only be performed if no additional columns should be kept, to avoid ambiguities.
If the parameter keep is set to something other than NA, it has priority and aggregation is
suppressed.}

\item{keep}{Optional vector of column names from which information should be kept
in each voxel of the output. E.g. choose keep=c("X", "Y", "TreeID") if stem positions and
ID of each tree should be available for each voxel. X and Y are special cases, because in
the output the columns "X" and "Y" specify the voxel coordinates. Thus, the columns
containing the stem coordinates are renamed to "Xstem" and "Ystem". Other kept columns
will appear in the output under their original input name.}
