# slidaRtools
Tools for lidar simulation and lidar processing

## Introduction 
The slidaRtools package provides a couple of useful functions to simulate and process lidar data of forests. 
Lidar simulation means to create discrete lidar point clouds or large footprint waveforms for a given tree list 
using their positions, crown properties and a Beer-Lambert light extinction approach. Lidar data processing means 
operations like point cloud thinning, conversions between XYZ-tables, rasters, matrices and arrays, outlier 
filtering, spatial indexing, vertical profile delineation, etc.

## Demo
A demo script can be found inside the folder DemoWorkflow, along with a small example dataset.
