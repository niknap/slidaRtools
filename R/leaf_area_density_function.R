#' Reconstruct leaf area density (LAD) from lidar point clouds
#'
#' Function to reconstruct leaf area density (LAD) per volume based on the
#' MacArthur-Horn equation, which inverts the Beer-Lambert principle of
#' light extinction. It provides an estimate of LAD per voxel.
#'
#' @param pc Point cloud in data.table, data.frame or LAS format
#' (important: column names need to be X, Y and Z)
#' @param xy.res Side length of a voxel in the horizontal plain
#' @param z.res Side length of a voxel in vertical direction
#' @param k Conversion coefficient (light extinction coefficient)
#' @param min.out For voxels with zero outgoing pulses, the LAD cannot be
#' calculated from the MH equation (division by 0), thus these voxels would
#' get NA. However, if there are return in them, there has to be leaf area in
#' them. min.out allows to specify a minimum number of outgoing pulses
#' for such cases, to not lose the leaf area in these voxels.
#' @param normalized Boolean whether the point cloud is terrain normalized or
#' not. For normalized point clouds all points of height < 0.5 m are considered
#' ground points. For non-normalized point clouds a column "Classification" is
#' required and ground points should be labelled.
#' @param ground.class Only required for non-normalized point clouds. It
#' provides the numeric code of ground points in the "Classification" column.
#' The standard value is 2.
#' @return data.table with each row representing one voxel. Coordinates
#' represent voxel centers and LAD and cumulative LAI are given for each voxel
#' @export
#' @examples in progress
