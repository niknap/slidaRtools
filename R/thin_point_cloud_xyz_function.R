#' Point cloud thinning in 1D, 2D or 3D
#'
#' Function that thins a point cloud to a desired homogenous
#' point density by keeping a random subset of n points
#' in each spatial unit and discarding all other points.
#' Spatial units are defined by their dimensions, i.e. 3D voxels (xyz),
#' 2D cells (most commonly in xy plane), or can even be just along one
#' dimension (e.g. slices in z direction).
#' @param pc Point cloud in data.table, data.frame or LAS format (important: column names need to be X, Y and Z)
#' @param res Side length of a spatial unit (equal in all dimensions)
#' @param n Number of points to keep in each cell
#' @param dim Axes that define the thinning units, e.g. "xyz" for 3D voxels, "xy" for 2D grid cells in the horizontal plane,...
#' @return Thinned point cloud in same format as input
#' @export
#' @examples in progress
