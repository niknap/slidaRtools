#' Remove outliers from point cloud
#'
#' Function that removes points from a point cloud if their Z-value exceeds
#' the given percentile of their neighborhood's Z-values by a certain factor.
#' @param pc Input point cloud (first 3 columns need to be "X", "Y" and "Z")
#' @param n Number of considered neighbor points (with lowest XY-distance to focal point)
#' @param low.perc Lower end of the desired interquantile range (fraction between 0 and 1)
#' @param high.perc Upper end of the desired interquantile range (fraction between 0 and 1)
#' @param fac Factor by which a Z-value needs to exceed or subceed the IQR of its neighbors to be considered an outlier
#' @param high bool if false high outliers will not be removed
#' @param low bool if false low outliers will not be removed
#' @return Point cloud dataframe with rows from the input that were detected as outliers removed
#' @keywords point cloud outlier filter clean percentile IQR
#' @export
#' @examples in progress
