Title: Tools for lidar simulation and lidar processing
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Nikolai Knapp
Maintainer: Nikolai Knapp <nikolai.knapp@ufz.de>
Description: This package provides a couple of useful functions to simulate and
    process lidar data of forests. Lidar simulation means to create discrete lidar
    point clouds for a given tree list using their positions, crown properties and
    a Beer-Lambert light extinction approach. Lidar data processing means operations
    like point cloud thinning, conversions between XYZ-tables, rasters, matrices and
    arrays, outlier filtering, spatial indexing, vertical profile delineation, etc.
    Additionally, the package contains a set of functions to calculate common field-
    inventory-based and lidar-based metrics for forest stands.
