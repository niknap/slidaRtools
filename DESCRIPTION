Description: This package provides a couple of useful functions to simulate and
    process lidar data of forests. Lidar simulation means to create discrete 
    lidar point clouds or large footprint waveforms for a given tree list 
    using their positions, crown properties and a Beer-Lambert light 
    extinction approach. Lidar data processing means operations like point 
    cloud thinning, conversions between XYZ-tables, rasters, matrices and
    arrays, spatial indexing, vertical profile delineation, etc.
